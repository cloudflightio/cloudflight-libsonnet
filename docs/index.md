Welcome to the documentation of the _Cloudflight jsonnet library_.

This library contains utilities and premade modules to ease working
with Kubernets and OpenShift.

To get started, take a look at the [guides](guides/) or the [module
documentation](modules/).

If you know your way around jsonnet already, why not take a look at our [complete library](library/)?

If you want support for your editor you should use one of the plugins listed on
the [tools](https://jsonnet.org/learning/tools.html) page. We recommend plugins
based on the [jsonnet-language
server](https://github.com/grafana/jsonnet-language-server).


!!! info

    `cloudflight-libsonnet` is inteded to be used with [Tanka](https://tanka.dev).
    Other tools might work, however we do not test for them. If you're using
    `kubecfg`, take a look at [our migration guide](guides/tanka_migration/).
